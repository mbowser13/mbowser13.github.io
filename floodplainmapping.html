<p>For this project I acquired a list of 847 projects initially endorsed under HUDâ€™s multifamily mortgage insurance program between 2010 and 2015. Projects were mapped using ArcMap. Locations of all structures at each project site were determined relative to:
the 100-year floodplain, the freeboard value floodplain and the 500-year floodplain.

<p>Where FEMA data were available, the extent of the 100-year floodplain and 500-year floodplain and 100-year BFE at each project location was determined using FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Insurance Studies (FISs) </p>

<p>A project was identified as in the 100-year floodplain if any structure at the project site was located in the 100-year floodplain according to the FIRM. A project was identified as in the freeboard value floodplain if the ground elevation of any structure at the project site was located within 2 feet of the 100-year BFE of the nearest 100-year floodplain. 100-year BFE values were determined using FEMA FIRMs. </p>
